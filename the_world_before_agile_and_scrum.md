**The World Before Agile & Scrum**

Learning Objectives:
1. What was wrong with traditional methods of project management
2. What the Waterfall Model is and Why it is less flexible than Agile
3. What Agile is & How it differs from Scrum

The Waterfall Model (The diagram looks like a waterfall)
- Analysis
    - Requirements specifications
        - Design
            - Implementation
                - Testing and integration
                    - Operation and Maintenance

Flaws of the Waterfall method
- Changing requirements affact the deadline
- Defects found too late, usually during the test phase, usually requires more time to test.


**The Birth of Agile/Umbrella**

With Iteration the company can
- Release a few features early
- Make some early R.O.I
- Discover potential issues early
- Change requirements often
- React tt change through replanning (people pinching) 
- Lightweight / simple solutions
- The meeting of all the heads lead to the Agile Manifesto

**Manifesto for Agile Software Develpemnt** 

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others to o it. Through this work we have come to value:

Individuals and ineractions                     OVER                        Processes and tools
Working software                                                            Comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration                                                      Contract negotiation
Respondding to change                                                       Following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
